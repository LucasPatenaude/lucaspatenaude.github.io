# A Bit About Me

Hello everyone, my name is Luke Patenaude. I am 25 and I have been in Boulder for about 4 years and at CU for 2 now. My major is in Computer Science so I'm really looking forward to this course because I love experimenting with new technologies.

## Some Fun Facts About Me

1. Originally I'm from just outside of Minneapolis, so I love the winter.

2. My favorite sport is hockey. I played from when I was 6 years old to my senior year of high school. Currently, I mostly just watch but every so often I get out skating. I was a goalie so getting all the gear out is a bit of a logistical headache.

3. I love to play video games. My favorite games are Skyrim, Fallout: NV, and Rocket League. I don't get to play as much nowadays, but as you can tell I'm a big Bethesda fan so I'm really excited for Starfield. I'll probably get a good bit of gaming in with that coming out.

4. I love getting outdoors. Growing up I did a lot of camping in the north woods of Minnesota, so being in a spectacularily beautiful place like Boulder I'm always trying to get a hike or drive in to the mountains.
